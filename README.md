# DAMG7250_NYC_Tree_Plantation


Using the assigned dataset, each team should analyze and build an analytical dashboard as a Proof-of-concept to illustrate the value of data-driven analytics. You need to present your dataset on the assignment due date.  Please check your data Set Criteria for the following criteria– at least 500k records and  25+ columns. If your file does not meet these criteria, please contact Isham by no later than Wednesday 2/23/2022. 

## Goals
To work with datasets, Perform/Create:<br>
1. Group Assignment/Project on Velero with below mentioned activities:<br>
    * Tasks/ Project Short/ Long Form/ Group Allocation/ Timesheet/ Issues & Risks. <br>
3. Data Profiling – Using the Python profiling library, describe your understanding of the data.  
4. Data Wrangling and Cleansing - Pandas/Alteryx/XSV 
    * Filtering and aggregating if needed 
    * Missing value handling 
    * Deriving additional columns from existing datasets if needed 
    * Cleaning (removing blank spaces, formatting dates, Capitalizing, etc.)  
5. Database Installation: Install NEO4J database  
6. Design a graph database base on your understanding of the data in your file 
7. Perform data mapping and Integration to your database for the entire dataset 
8. Business and Technical Metadata – develop a business term list describing all the data elements available in the file 
9. Data Validation and Data Visualization using Python – Validate the data using python and provide a dashboard using python visualization libraries.  
10. System Integration and User Acceptance Testing - Test Cases – describe your validation & testing process. 
11. Risks/Issues of the project – Identify and associated issues/risks 
12. Describe data challenges encountered and how you resolved them. 
13. End-User Instructions (Steps to run your Dashboard) – provide a full description of how to run your process: 
 
## Big data architecture & Governance 

1. Database Creation and load 
1. Visualization interpretation, describe information regarding your findings Visualization Deliverables: Once you wrangle/clean/join/integrate the data, import the data into NEO4J and illustrate how to use the appropriate graph to illustrate various aspects of analysis.  

## Questions to consider 
1. Columns used for dimensions, and columns that are used for measurement. 
1. How would you generate new dimensions?  
1. Who would use this dashboard and how do they benefit from your dashboard?  
1. What value would be generated using this dashboard? 
### Other Deliverables: 
1. Presentation of the entire work from the first step to the dashboards including the Velero screenshots 
1. Business and technical metadata presentation – Identifying all available business terms and extracting related technical metadata  
1. A complete explanation of the dashboard and usability 
1. Complete instruction on how to implement and run the database load, technical metadata extraction, and dashboard.
